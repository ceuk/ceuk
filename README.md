## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack developer and product manager living in the UK.

### Background 

In the past, I've launched (and sold) a successful software company as well working for a large development company that bulds software for the UK Public Sector and other national institutions. 

### Interests 

I'm a huge open-source fan/advocate and naturally love all things GNU/Linux. My most successful open-source project is [SpoTUI](https://github.com/ceuk/spotui) - a terminal-based Spotify player.

I'm really into [desktop ricing](https://reddit.com/r/unixporn) and currently use [Awesome WM](https://awesomewm.org/) as my primary window manager. I'm also really interested in UX, product management, programming (obviously), and service design.

### My work

I am currently working on a new startup with a co-founder in addition to contributing to Open-Source projects when/where I can.

You can support my work by becoming a [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/ceuk).
