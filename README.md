### About Me

I'm a big open-source fan and naturally love all things GNU/Linux. My most successful (if you go by stars) open-source project is [SpoTUI](https://github.com/ceuk/spotui) - a terminal-based Spotify player.

I'm really into [desktop ricing](https://reddit.com/r/unixporn) and currently use [Awesome WM](https://awesomewm.org/) as my primary window manager. I'm also really interested in UX, product management, programming (obviously), and service design.

### My work

I am currently working on my second startup with a co-founder in addition to contributing to doing some Open-Source stuff.

You can support my open source work by becoming a [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/ceuk).
